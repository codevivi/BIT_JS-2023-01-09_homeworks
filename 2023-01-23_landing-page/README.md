# Landing page (responsive)

Website template recreation (clone) for learning purposes

HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS for responsive navigation and header effect.

## Todo for myself

- [x] Fix bottom nav input hover effect, now it cuts word when wrapping.

- [x] Add active class to nav links on scroll (JS)).

- [ ] Try to implement image carousel functionality (JS).
