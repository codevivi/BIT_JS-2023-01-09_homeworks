# Landing page (responsive)

Website template recreation (clone) for learning purposes

HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS for responsive navigation and header effect.

[Landing page üåê](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/codevivi/BIT_JS-2023-01-09_homeworks/blob/master/2023-01-23_landing-page/index.html)

## Todo for myself

1. Fix bottom nav input hover effect, now it cuts word when wrapping.
   Maby do with text-indent ...

2. Add active class to nav links on scroll (JS)).

3. Try to implement image carousel functionality (JS).
