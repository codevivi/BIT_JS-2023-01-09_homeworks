# JS homework **2023-02-08**

[Preview solution visualisation üåê](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/codevivi/BIT_JS-2023-01-09_homeworks/blob/master/2023-02-08_JS/index.html)

Nails hammering with loops.

Added animation just for fun.

## Possible improvements, fixes

- Stage reuse. One board with 2 buttons for a and b tasks.
- Custom settings instead of a and b tasks. Options for nail height...(currently only possible to change in main.js)
- Enable reset on another click
- Pouse and speed settings
- Think of better project to improve :)
